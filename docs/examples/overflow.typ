== Training loop

=== Steps of one epoch

+ Shuffle the training set
+ Split it into batches
+ Forward pass on the batch
+ Compute the loss
+ Backward pass
+ Update the weights
+ Repeat for every batch
+ Evaluate on the validation set
+ Save the best weights
+ Check the stopping rule
+ Decay the learning rate
+ Log the metrics
+ Plot the learning curves
+ Compare with the baseline
+ Start the next epoch
